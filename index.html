            <h1>Reasons Why</h1>
          <p>Now there could be a multitude of reasons as to why a kid might shoot up a school. They could have a mental problem, they could not get along with their parents, or they could be a victom of physical abuse. however most people tend to think that the reason people tend to shoot up schools is because they want to get back at the people who hurt them. Say you are bullying someone and they are going through some bad things at home. One day you push them over the edge and the next day they bring the gun to school. To avoid this you should just try to get along with as much people as you can so that they will not do anything durastic. Don't bully anyone either.</p>

            <h1>Where the students get their guns from</h1>
          <p>When students get bullied they go home they could plan the school shooting. Now where would they get the gun? Well they could get it from a store,a friend could give it to them or they could get it from their own home. Since the pandemic starting in 2019 more and more people have been purchasing firarms. If you are a parent and have a firearm make sure you keep it secure and locked away from your child. Try lock it and hide so that your child can't get to it. If you feel like your child might be planning to do something you can also try to talk to them before they do something durastic.  </p>
